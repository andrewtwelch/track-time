# track-time

track-time is a dead simple time tracking app that works unlike every other time tracking app I could find in half an hour of Googling.

## Installation

Put the file somewhere and run it, you'll need to run it with an argument to add entries at the moment.

## Usage

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| app.py | Loads the menu |
| app.py help | Shows a help screen |
| app.py add | Shows the add entry prompt |
| app.py list | Lists today's entries |
| app.py listtoday | Also lists today's entries |
| app.py listall | Lists all entries |
| app.py clear | Clears entries (this won't prompt for confirmation yet, it just clears immediately |
